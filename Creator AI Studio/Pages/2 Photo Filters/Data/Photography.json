A rectangular beam of golden sunlight from a window hits the wall, casting a crisp shadow silhouette inside the bright frame.

Pose: elbows on thighs, hands loosely clasped, chin slightly lifted, eyes looking toward the light, calm and confident expression.\n\nLighting: hard warm sunlight from camera-right as the key, soft ambient bounce fill, high contrast with long shadows, cinematic golden-hour mood.\n\nCamera & composition: low-mid angle from a few steps below, 50–85mm f/2.2 lens, shallow depth of field, clean optics, realistic skin texture, fine film grain, subtle vignette.\n\nStyle: minimalist background, no clutter, fashion editorial realism. Keep all proportions, facial features, hair, and body shape accurate.\n\nExclude: cartoon, CGI, AI artifacts, over-smoothing, plastic skin, excessive sharpening, motion blur, warped anatomy, extra fingers, disfigured hands, double shadow, blown highlights, banding, watermark, logo, text, bad perspective, dirty wall, clutter."
