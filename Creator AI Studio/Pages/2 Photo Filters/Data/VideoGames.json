    "prompt": "Transform the subject of the uploaded photo into a 3-frame superhero comic. Preserve the subject’s facial identity, hair color, hairstyle, and body shape while converting them into a dynamic Marvel-style comic character.\n\nFrame 1: The subject discovers their powers in a visually dramatic moment, with expressive poses, bold inked outlines, and vibrant Marvel-style colors.\n\nFrame 2: Training and preparation montage condensed into one dynamic scene, showing the subject practicing powers and building strength with energetic panel composition.\n\nFrame 3: Climactic battle and victory moment in a futuristic city: the subject confronts a villain, protects civilians, and strikes a heroic victory pose. Include readable English text if desired.\n\nEnsure consistent art style, bold color palette, and inked comic outlines across all frames. Keep facial identity, body, and hair accurate while applying dynamic superhero comic stylization."

Establish a consistent color palette, line style, proportions, lighting, and art direction across the entire image.\n\nCompose the image as a complete narrative moment, like a key frame or cover panel from a comic, using expressive poses, cinematic camera angles, and clear visual storytelling.\n\nInclude subtle environmental details and visual cues that imply a larger story without additional panels. Avoid extra characters unless they are clearly story-relevant.\n\nUse clean, readable composition, expressive linework, and balanced lighting. The final image should feel like a finished comic scene with strong storytelling impact, not a collage or multi-page layout."

    "prompt": "Transform the subject in the uploaded photo into a visually explosive and trendy pop-art anime illustration while strictly preserving the exact facial identity, features, and likeness of the real person in the reference photo. The face must remain instantly recognizable as the same individual—no generic anime face, no heavy stylization that alters bone structure, eye shape, nose, mouth, jawline, or unique facial details. Even under the extreme Persona 5 / graffiti style, the character’s real-world face must stay 100% consistent and accurate to the photo.\n\nThe overall style must be a high-contrast blend of Persona 5’s aesthetic and street graffiti visuals, making the subject look like an extremely flamboyant, extremely flat, ultra-cool anime figure—like an over-the-top chuunibyou character or a phantom thief preparing for a special attack.\n\n• Character and Shading: Apply sharp cel-shading with hard, clean lines and crisp contours. The pose must be exaggerated and full of motion. Use a wide-angle or fisheye perspective to make parts (like the hands or props) appear extremely close to the camera, emphasizing the action. The expression should be highly dramatic, confident, manic, or cold-blooded “overacting” intensity, but it must still be the same person’s face from the photo performing that expression.\n\n• Color and Contrast: Reject realistic volume and shading. Instead, rely on large areas of pure black heavy shadows and highly saturated flat color blocks to create an extreme, high-contrast flat look. Use a palette of bright red, lemon yellow, electric blue, and neon purple, contrasting them against large black shadow silhouettes. Hair and eye color should match the reference photo exactly unless the photo is black-and-white.\n\n• Texture and Graphics: Integrate screentones, halftone dots, speed lines, and radiating lines in the shadows and background to create a maximalist, layered graphic feel, like printed manga mixed with street art. Add rough spray paint, smears, or hand-drawn graffiti textures in select areas (avoid placing heavy textures directly over the face that would obscure identity).\n\n• Background and UI: The background should be a flat visual collage stage—not a realistic perspective space. Fill it with huge sans-serif English letters, torn paper effects, ink splatters, bold arrow graphics, speech bubbles, and onomatopoeia (e.g., “BOOM,” “SLASH,” “WAKE UP” graffiti sound effects). Seamlessly integrate game UI elements (health bars, skill names, tooltips, buttons) floating around the main character, merging the game interface and the illustration, breaking the fourth wall.\n\n• Mood and Resolution: Keep the lighting high-contrast and graphic, not physically realistic. Edges must be very sharp, without soft gradients. The final mood must be extremely dynamic, chuunibyou, and cool, like the image is about to explode off the screen. Avoid realistic painting styles, low-saturation vintage looks, soft pastels, and natural landscapes. The image should be a vertical 2:3 high-resolution illustration suitable as a tension-filled, maximalist pop-art manga poster.\n\nKey consistency directives (repeat for best results): –identitical face to reference, same person, preserve exact facial structure, do not change eye-smile or genericize, keep real proportions and unique traits of the uploaded person’s face even in extreme anime style, face must remain 100% recognizable."
