Preserve the subject’s facial identity, hairstyle, and body shape while adapting them into a dynamic comic illustration.\n\nPosition the subject in an iconic, heroic pose that conveys power, confidence, or mystery. Use cinematic camera angles, exaggerated perspective, and bold foreshortening for dramatic effect.\n\nCreate a striking background with visually symbolic or thematic elements, such as a futuristic cityscape, swirling energy, abstract patterns, or bold lighting effects. Use high-contrast, saturated colors with rim lighting or glow effects to make the cover visually impactful.\n\nKeep the composition clean, with a clear focal point on the subject. Optional space for a comic title or logo can be included. Avoid extra characters unless essential for visual storytelling. The final image should feel like a finished comic book cover, ready to grab attention on a shelf."

    "prompt": "Transform the subject in the uploaded photo into a visually explosive and trendy pop-art anime illustration while strictly preserving the exact facial identity, features, and likeness of the real person in the reference photo. The face must remain instantly recognizable as the same individual—no generic anime face, no heavy stylization that alters bone structure, eye shape, nose, mouth, jawline, or unique facial details. Even under the extreme Persona 5 / graffiti style, the character’s real-world face must stay 100% consistent and accurate to the photo.\n\nThe overall style must be a high-contrast blend of Persona 5’s aesthetic and street graffiti visuals, making the subject look like an extremely flamboyant, extremely flat, ultra-cool anime figure—like an over-the-top chuunibyou character or a phantom thief preparing for a special attack.\n\n• Character and Shading: Apply sharp cel-shading with hard, clean lines and crisp contours. The pose must be exaggerated and full of motion. Use a wide-angle or fisheye perspective to make parts (like the hands or props) appear extremely close to the camera, emphasizing the action. The expression should be highly dramatic, confident, manic, or cold-blooded “overacting” intensity, but it must still be the same person’s face from the photo performing that expression.\n\n• Color and Contrast: Reject realistic volume and shading. Instead, rely on large areas of pure black heavy shadows and highly saturated flat color blocks to create an extreme, high-contrast flat look. Use a palette of bright red, lemon yellow, electric blue, and neon purple, contrasting them against large black shadow silhouettes. Hair and eye color should match the reference photo exactly unless the photo is black-and-white.\n\n• Texture and Graphics: Integrate screentones, halftone dots, speed lines, and radiating lines in the shadows and background to create a maximalist, layered graphic feel, like printed manga mixed with street art. Add rough spray paint, smears, or hand-drawn graffiti textures in select areas (avoid placing heavy textures directly over the face that would obscure identity).\n\n• Background and UI: The background should be a flat visual collage stage—not a realistic perspective space. Fill it with huge sans-serif English letters, torn paper effects, ink splatters, bold arrow graphics, speech bubbles, and onomatopoeia (e.g., “BOOM,” “SLASH,” “WAKE UP” graffiti sound effects). Seamlessly integrate game UI elements (health bars, skill names, tooltips, buttons) floating around the main character, merging the game interface and the illustration, breaking the fourth wall.\n\n• Mood and Resolution: Keep the lighting high-contrast and graphic, not physically realistic. Edges must be very sharp, without soft gradients. The final mood must be extremely dynamic, chuunibyou, and cool, like the image is about to explode off the screen. Avoid realistic painting styles, low-saturation vintage looks, soft pastels, and natural landscapes. The image should be a vertical 2:3 high-resolution illustration suitable as a tension-filled, maximalist pop-art manga poster.\n\nKey consistency directives (repeat for best results): –identitical face to reference, same person, preserve exact facial structure, do not change eye-smile or genericize, keep real proportions and unique traits of the uploaded person’s face even in extreme anime style, face must remain 100% recognizable."
