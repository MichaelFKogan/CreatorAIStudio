Prompt #27: Add Character to Scene

Add a realistic-looking homeless man into this image. He has long brown hair and a long messy beard, and looks like he hasn't washed for months. He's wearing ripped tracksuit bottoms, boots, a checked shirt and a brown jacket. He has just walked into the bedroom and is carrying a small plastic bag with random belongings inside.
