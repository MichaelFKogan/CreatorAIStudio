    "prompt": "Transform the subject of the uploaded photo into a medium shot portrait while preserving her exact facial identity, hair color, hairstyle, and body shape.\n\nThe subject is a young woman with long dark brown hair, standing in a well-lit convenience store aisle between two large glass-door refrigerators filled with colorful drinks. She is wearing a white 'I [heart] PARIS' crop top and light-wash baggy low-rise jeans, with accessories including a black shoulder bag, small hoop earrings, and a belly button ring. Her right hand is touching her midriff near the navel piercing, and her left hand rests relaxed by her side. She looks away to her right with a neutral, contemplative expression.\n\nThe environment includes the brightly lit interiors of fridges, colorful labels, black metal frames, grey tiled floor, and 'Energy' signs on fridge headers. Lighting is bright, fluorescent, slightly cool, with soft minimal shadows cast mostly downwards from the front and above.\n\nThe composition is a medium, eye-level shot, slightly off-center, with shallow depth of field. The subject is aligned with the left vertical line of the rule of thirds. Emphasize smooth skin, cotton fabric, denim texture, glass, and plastic surfaces. Maintain consistent color palette with white, black, blue, and multi-colored products.\n\nThe overall style is candid, social-media portrait-like, casual and posed. The final image should read as a natural, photorealistic scene with accurate subject identity and proportions, with clear, bright lighting and visually engaging composition.\n\nOptional text or product labels may appear on t-shirts, fridge headers, and packaging, but the subject remains the clear focal point.\n\nNegative prompt: blurry, out of focus, low resolution, dark lighting, empty shelves, man, child, outdoor setting."

The trunk contains a transparent box and a yellow bottle or black tube attached to the side.\n\nLighting is hard direct flash in a 35mm analog style, creating stark highlights and shadows, with dark ambient background. The image should have a grainy film texture and convey an edgy, mysterious, candid atmosphere.\n\nEnsure the subject remains the focal point with accurate identity and proportions, while applying dramatic flash photography and cinematic composition.
