Apply the look of a harsh on-camera flash, resulting in bright highlights, deep, dark shadows, and a slight red-eye effect. The photograph must exhibit noticeable film grain and the characteristic blue-green tint often found in instant film. Enclose the photo in a clean, white Polaroid 600-style frame with a slight vignette effect within the image area.",
