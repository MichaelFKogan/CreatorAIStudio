    "prompt": "Use the uploaded photo as a reference and preserve 100% of the subject’s face and identity.\n\nGenerate a realistic outdoor portrait of the person standing in a dense field of tall white flowers with organic centers.

Shadows are subtle.\n\nCamera: vertical 4:5 close-to-medium portrait, eye-level perspective, lens 85-105mm full-frame equivalent for soft natural field focus.\n\nThe subject should appear integrated into the flower field, not superimposed. Avoid altering face, adding text/logos, distorting flowers or clothing, or leaving empty backgrounds.\n\nFinal output: ultra-realistic, high-resolution, immersive floral editorial portrait in 4K."
